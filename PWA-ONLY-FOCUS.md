## 🎯 Why PWA Only?

### Benefits
1. **Universality**
   - Works on iOS (Safari 11.3+)
   - Works on Android (Chrome, Edge)
   - Works on Desktop
   - Single codebase

2. **No Barriers**
   - No app store approval
   - No $99 Apple Developer account
   - No Google Play fees
   - No waiting for review

3. **Better UX**
   - Instant access via URL
   - Automatic updates
   - Smaller download size
   - Easy to "uninstall" (remove from home screen)

4. **Same Capabilities**
   - Full Geolocation API access
   - High-accuracy GPS
   - Background sync
   - Offline storage
   - Push notifications (future)

5. **Development Benefits**
   - Single codebase to maintain
   - Faster iteration
   - No build/signing complexity
   - Instant deployment

### Why Archive Native Apps?

Native apps are archived (not deleted) because:
- ✅ PWA solves 90% of use cases
- ✅ PWA is faster to develop/maintain
- ✅ Native apps add complexity
- ✅ Can enable later if needed
- ✅ Code preserved in `_ARCHIVED/mobile/`

Native apps **might** be needed for:
- Background GPS when app is closed (iOS restrictions apply)
- Push notifications (Safari doesn't support yet)
- App Store presence for discoverability
- Enterprise features requiring MDM

For now, PWA is the best solution.

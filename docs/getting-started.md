## 🔑 Key Concepts

### ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast)
A surveillance technology where aircraft determine their position via satellite navigation and periodically broadcast it, enabling tracking by ground stations.

### Time-Series Data
Data points indexed in time order, crucial for storing aircraft position history and enabling temporal analysis.

### Microservices Architecture
An architectural style where the application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over APIs.

### Real-Time Processing
Processing data as it arrives with minimal latency, essential for live aircraft tracking and immediate alerts.

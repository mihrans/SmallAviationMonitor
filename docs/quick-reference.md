## 🎓 Key Concepts

### ADS-B
Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast - aircraft broadcast position data that can be received by ground stations

### Time-Series Data
Data indexed by timestamp, essential for aircraft position history and temporal analysis

### Microservices
Architectural style with small, independent services communicating via APIs

### Real-Time Processing
Processing data as it arrives with minimal latency for live tracking and alerts

### RBAC
Role-Based Access Control - granular permissions based on user roles

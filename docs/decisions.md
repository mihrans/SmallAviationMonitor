## Decisions

### Decision #001: Microservices Architecture
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Decision**: Use microservices architecture with event-driven components  
**Rationale**: 
- Allows independent scaling of components
- Provides technology flexibility
- Enables fault isolation
- Supports real-time event processing
- Facilitates team independence

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Monolithic architecture (simpler initially but less flexible)
- Serverless architecture (cost-effective but less control)
- Hybrid approach (complexity without full benefits)

**Impact**: 
- More complex initial setup
- Requires container orchestration
- Need for API gateway
- Distributed system monitoring required
- Better long-term scalability

**Status**: Active (Proposed)

### Decision #002: Time-Series Database for Flight Data
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Decision**: Use dedicated time-series database for aircraft position data  
**Rationale**:
- Optimized for timestamp-indexed data
- Better compression ratios
- Efficient for temporal queries
- Supports retention policies
- High write throughput

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Relational database only (less optimized for time-series)
- NoSQL document store (not optimized for temporal data)
- Distributed file system (complex querying)

**Impact**:
- Additional database system to manage
- Better performance for tracking queries
- Efficient storage of historical data
- Specialized expertise needed

**Status**: Active (Proposed)

### Decision #003: Cloud-Native Deployment
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Decision**: Design for cloud deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP)  
**Rationale**:
- Scalability and elasticity
- Managed services availability
- Global reach for future expansion
- High availability built-in
- Pay-as-you-grow model

**Alternatives Considered**:
- On-premises deployment (high initial cost, less flexible)
- Hybrid cloud (added complexity)
- Single cloud vs. multi-cloud (decided to start with one)

**Impact**:
- Ongoing operational costs
- Vendor-specific features may be used
- Need cloud expertise
- Better disaster recovery options
- Faster time to market

**Status**: Active (Proposed)

### Decision #004: RESTful API with WebSocket for Real-Time
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Decision**: Use REST for standard operations, WebSocket for real-time updates  
**Rationale**:
- REST is well-understood and tooling-rich
- WebSocket provides true real-time push
- Clear separation of concerns
- Standard HTTP for most operations
- Efficient for frequent updates

**Alternatives Considered**:
- GraphQL (more complex, overkill for use case)
- Server-Sent Events (less bidirectional)
- Polling (inefficient)
- gRPC (better for service-to-service, less browser-friendly)

**Impact**:
- Two protocols to maintain
- Clear patterns for different use cases
- Better performance for real-time features
- Standard REST for everything else

**Status**: Active (Proposed)

### Decision #005: Containerization with Docker/Kubernetes
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Decision**: Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration  
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard
- Cloud-agnostic deployment
- Excellent scaling capabilities
- Rich ecosystem of tools
- Reproducible environments

**Alternatives Considered**:
- VM-based deployment (less efficient)
- Platform-specific orchestration (vendor lock-in)
- Serverless containers (less control)

**Impact**:
- Learning curve for team
- More complex initial setup
- Better portability and scaling
- Consistent dev/prod environments

**Status**: Active (Proposed)

### Decision #006: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Decision**: Implement RBAC for authorization  
**Rationale**:
- Flexible permission management
- Scales well with organization growth
- Industry best practice
- Supports multi-tenant architecture
- Clear security model

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Simple user/admin roles (too limiting)
- Attribute-based access control (overly complex)
- Organization-only isolation (not granular enough)

**Impact**:
- More complex permission logic
- Flexible for various use cases
- Easier to add new roles/permissions
- Better security posture

**Status**: Active (Proposed)

---

### Decision #007: Multi-Tenant Architecture
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Decision**: Design system for multiple organizations from the start  
**Rationale**:
- Easier to implement early than retrofit
- Supports business model flexibility
- Resource efficiency
- Simpler deployment model
- Better for SaaS offering

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single-tenant per deployment (less efficient)
- Add multi-tenancy later (harder to retrofit)
- Hybrid approach (added complexity)

**Impact**:
- Data isolation requirements
- Complexity in authorization
- Better resource utilization
- More scalable business model

**Status**: Active (Proposed)

### Decision #008: Phased Development Approach
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Decision**: Develop in clear phases with MVP approach  
**Rationale**:
- Faster time to market
- Early user feedback
- Risk reduction
- Funding/resource flexibility
- Iterative improvement

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Big-bang release (higher risk)
- Continuous delivery without phases (less structure)

**Impact**:
- Need to prioritize features carefully
- Earlier user feedback
- More predictable timelines
- Easier to manage scope

**Status**: Active (Confirmed)

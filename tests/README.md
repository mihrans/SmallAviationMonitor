# Tests Directory

This directory will contain all automated tests for the SmallAviationMonitor system.

## Planned Test Structure

```
tests/
├── unit/            # Unit tests for individual components
├── integration/     # Integration tests for component interactions
├── e2e/            # End-to-end tests for full workflows
├── performance/     # Performance and load tests
└── fixtures/        # Test data and fixtures
```

## Testing Strategy
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD approach)
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Automate test execution in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular performance and security testing

## Testing Tools (To Be Determined)
- Unit testing framework
- Integration testing framework
- E2E testing framework
- Performance testing tools
- Code coverage tools

## 🍎 iOS Distribution (Cannot Do Direct Download)

### Why No Direct APK for iOS?

**Apple's Security Policy:**
- iOS does not allow direct app installation like Android
- All apps must go through Apple's distribution channels
- This is by design for security and user protection

### iOS Distribution Options

#### Option 1: TestFlight (Beta Testing) ✅ Recommended
- **Cost**: $99/year (Apple Developer Account)
- **Users**: Up to 10,000 beta testers
- **Duration**: 90 days per build

- **User Experience**:
  1. Install TestFlight app from App Store (one-time)
  2. Open TestFlight invitation link (can be QR code!)
  3. Install GPS Logger app
  4. Auto-updates with new builds

**How to Set Up:**
```bash

# Update bundle identifier

# 4. Archive and upload to TestFlight

# 5. Share TestFlight link

```

#### Option 2: App Store (Official Release) ✅ Best Long-term
- **Cost**: $99/year (same Apple Developer Account)

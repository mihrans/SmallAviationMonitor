## 📋 Project Overview

SmallAviationMonitor is a real-time GPS tracking and airspace monitoring web application designed for pilots operating various types of aircraft including small and large aircraft, drones, paragliders, and hot air balloons. The system enables worldwide traffic monitoring and airspace reservation management through GPS polygon-based reservations.

### Current Status: **Active Development**
The frontend has been developed with React + TypeScript + Vite. Currently integrating existing codebase and preparing for Cloudflare Pages deployment with API backend on Cloudflare Workers.

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Implemented
- **Real-time GPS Device Tracking**: Monitor positions of aircraft, drones, paragliders, and balloons
- **Interactive Map Display**: Real-time visualization on an interactive map
- **Multiple Device Types**: Support for various aviation equipment types
- **Device Status Monitoring**: Online/offline/warning status tracking
- **Connection Statistics**: Monitor API and TCP/IP connections
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with dark mode support

### 🚧 In Development
- **API Receiver Endpoints**: Accept GPS data via REST API
- **TCP/IP Connections**: Direct device connections via TCP/IP protocol
- **Airspace Reservation System**: GPS polygon + altitude + time-based reservations
- **Alert Queue System**: Cloudflare Queue integration for notifications
- **Worldwide Deployment**: Global edge deployment on Cloudflare

### 📋 Planned
- **User Authentication**: Pilot accounts and access control
- **Notification System**: Real-time alerts for conflicts and issues
- **Historical Playback**: Review past flight paths and reservations
- **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile experience
